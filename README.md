My game engine and a basic neural net program

Started after finishing the project for the EdX course CSMM 101x Colombia X AI course. 
I wanted to be able to use a simple feed forward neural net to play the game, 
or at least come up with better heuristics than I used for my A* search. 

The NN code appears to be working, but has not been extensively tested. 

I ran out of time to get it to play the game.. 

I would like to hook the heuristics I hand coded in to the game, but use the NN to improve 
using them as a teaching algorithm to give better feedback.
